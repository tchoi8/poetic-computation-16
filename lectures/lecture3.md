In this lecture, I examine the concept of Control Society to think about the management of contemporary time and space. I ask the students if it is possible to imagine a ‘New Weapon’ by subverting the mechanisms of surveillance. 


##Call center, border control, casino 


I want to start today’s lecture by thinking about the call centers. Let's imagine your perfectly orchestrated life is disrupted when you lose your credit card and have to contact the call center. The call center is a place with no memory, you have to constantly repeat yourself and prove your identity. In a sense, it is a blank space that doesn’t remember you and you also don’t know where the call is taking place. “Kafkaesque labyrinth of call centers, a world without memory, where cause and effect connect together in mysterious, unfathomable ways.” In reality, call centers may have a lot of information about you, but the operators can’t access them until you prove your identity. In a sense, we don’t know who the operators are and they don’t know who we are, but they have access to information of where we are and what we do.

The article “Mexicans deported by U.S. find jobs in border call centers” follows a troubling story of second generation Mexican-Americans who provide customer service to American corporations such as Best Buy or Target. Born and raised in the U.S. but deported when they become adults, they consider the U.S. as home and speak Spanish as a second language. The article elaborates on the sense of disconnection they feel based on where they are physically and where they are psychologically. The call center is a place that reveal the human labor behind the smooth appearance of automation.

*In a society of control, the corporation has replaced the factory, and the corporation is a spirit, a gas.*  Gilles Deleuze, Postscript on the Societies of Control

Traditionally border controls are physical gates, but this talks about corporations that are becoming gas, very invisible factors that govern and distinguish inside, outside, here, there and one nation to another nation. The border control becomes this invisible layer apparatus that is not tangible and becomes more of a notion of where things begin. Deleuze also talks about the vision of Guattari’s city without walls, a city where you could go anywhere but you are controled by your credit card or monitored. 

Geoff Manaugh, a writer and architectural theorist who runs the building blog, talks about the casino in a really interesting way. Casinos in the past, or any other gambling place, were traditionally places without time. There are no clocks or windows, it is a very enclosed space, and the security or surveillance was usually an afterthought. But ever since the 1980s onward the buildings themselves have been designed around surveillance. Manaugh talks about this amazing four step escalator that is in a lot of Las Vegas casinos, it is totally not necessary. The only reason for these escalators is that we go through them so that the camera can get a perfect mug shot of us. There are multiple four step escalators to get into the casino. Also it is saying that this kind of flat level escalators, like in airports, are camera apparatuses. This means that entire buildings are acting as optical apparatuses. The more alarming thing is that this same logic of control and surveillance expands to the city, and Manaugh talks about Las Vegas specifically, that the citizens actually want surveillance for safety reasons. There are great videos and articles about how these systems of control dominate casinos. It is used for two reasons, safety reasons and also to monitor the game players to document what is happening.

I think we are all familiar with Foucault’s critique of panopticon, a place where the central eye and since the subjects don’t know when they are being watched they are always internalizing the control. This model was very predominant from the nineteenth-century onward, Millbank Prison is a good example of an actual structure that was built with this protocol. You can see that it is a multiple panel within the same structure. You can see in the 1821 floor pln that this isn’t just about architecture, but that this is a statement. It is a statement about how we are disciplining the society. This is a place where they kept a lot of prisoners before they sent them away to Australia, for example. What is frightening is that a hundred years later, the same mechanics are in place with the Pentagon. The Pentagon started construction in 1941 and you can see that it is panopticons within panopticons. It is different layers that are very tightly knit to create this systems of control. I talked about von Neumann as the CPU architect and the person who wanted to bomb Kyoto instead of Hiroshima because that would have a greater effect on Japan because of the cultural heritage of the place. This is the Manhattan Project and beginning of nuclear warfare, not an end to WWII but the beginning of the Cold War. We can begin to think of these wars as continual processes of domination through technology. The Pentagon, in a sense, the Manhattan project was beginning to be developed right on the sight, they were beginning to think of the larger systems of control that would go beyond WWII. 

Deleuze is not a technical philosopher, he is more of a cartographer of technologies, he looks at how systems of repetition and abstraction creates a cultural landscape. He is probably most known for this notion of rhizomatic systems of control. This specific text is a very special writing, written towards the end of his life, and he changes his notion of the radical restructuring of the world to examining the systems of control that we have. He shifts the notion from mechanical control to this notion of code. Recently, within the past five years, there is a renewed interest in this specific text because of the dominance that code has in our daily life.

##Control Society 

 
In Deleuze's interpretation, a disciplinary society is a space of 19th-century Capitalism. It is a concentration of production forces and Analogical production. The difference between Analogical and Digital forces of labor is that one is a 'mold' of labor and the other is a 'modulation' of labor. This difference becomes more apparent when we think about our bodies as human forces in production. In 19th-century, being an individual was different from being part of the mass. The capitalists need mass to produce and consume the products. Now, we are dividuals, separated within ourselves. 

*The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks."* – Gilles Deleuze, Postscript on the Societies of Control

The notion of corporations as a gas, that the companies have a soul, is an interesting concept. It’s a bit different from a company having a human face. It is a company that embodies an emotional and psychological aspect which we relate to. Thus, the fact some people think “Google is your friend” or “Facebook is where my friends live” is very integral to the control society. 

There are some confusing metaphors in the reading like the mole and serpent. The mole is a small animal that makes mazes underground, and the serpent is a snake that moves smoothly between the terrains. The mole represents a traditionally Capitalism. There's a hierarchical structure which resembles paternal power, a boss and managers and a distribution of labor among the workforce. The serpent represents all the free-flowing bodies in Capitalist space, freelancers, and the precariats, who are laborers of the new generation. The key concept in this essay is the shift from production to financialization. Production is like the Fordist model of producing things from materials, natural resources. Whereas, financialization is like the High-frequency trading in the one extreme and Yelp, and other systems of peer reviews and sharing economy on the other extreme. Our participation in these particular systems of financialising social interaction leads to further business. Social media network product values through financialising our attention span. 

Foucault describes homes, schools, factories, hospitals, armies, and even prisons as spaces centered around the same protocol of discipline. In these spaces, there are something you can do and something you can’t do and if you do the wrong thing you get punished. All the spaces in between are unregulated and unorganized areas. These spaces are called 'everyday life.' There's a romantic notion that only outside of the confinement of the rules, everyday life and the freedom of speech constitutes our relationship with each other. It’s this place of unmonitored everyday life that maybe the keyword for our quest. 

This thought relates to the Jonathan Crary's book 24/7 and the notion of sleep as a place that has not been monitored until recently. According to Crary, sleep is the only place that the Capitalism or technology cannot intervene directly.  The unboundedness of sleep can be the uncontrollable space in the new society of control.

*In actuality there is an imposed and inescapable uniformity to our compulsory labor of self-management. The illusion of choice and autonomy is one of the foundations of this global system of auto-regulation.* – Jonathan Crary, 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep


Deleuze's metaphor of highways is probably the most poignant metaphor of the Internet. In the popular culture, there is the concept of the American wild west and the highways.  The highways give an impression that we can go anywhere at any speed and we have autonomous control of our being. However, highways multiply the forms of control, because there are checkpoints at every entrance and exit, and the system knows where we are and what we are consuming. The continuous control is the instant communications.   

This a good time to think about control and what that means for us historically. Deleuze talks about how Jonathan Barrows was inspired by cybernetics of the mid-nineteenth and the twentieth century. Cybernetics can be described in a simple diagram of feedback, an input and there is a connection between the output into the input. It is a self-regulating system. For example, when I move my finger,  I don’t think about what my finger is doing. However, my body is able to self-regulate my movement and I'm aware of the systems that govern every other parts of my body.  The cyberneticians thought of the self-regulating system can be applied to the machines, animals and humans alike. The cybernetics was deployed for servo mechanisms at the end of the WWII for controlling long trajectory missiles.  The cybernetic philosophers were technocratic and they had this notion that everything could be explained with cybernetics. Their idea is different from the concept of Artificial Intelligence, but it became the dominant lens for how the public thought about human and machine relations after the 1960s and influenced the idea of AI later on. 

Building from Crary and Deleuze's concepts, we can think of the society of control, not as a distinctly different thing from the society of discipline but as layers that are on top of it amplifying the control mechanisms. This shift leads to an extreme personalization and individuation of machine interfaces, such as operating systems and the addiction to communication, we are compelled to communicate with each other constantly. 


##Utopia as such

Utopia is a place of no place, it is a place that we cannot go, in Thomas Moore and many others imagined. Contemporary artists often consider Utopia as a direction, as in Steve Lamber’s poster provocatives. Is utopia as a destination not a realistic notion? Utopia, as a concept, has been a great source of inspiration for many artists. 


Instead of thinking about utopia as a place, let’s think about utopia in terms of periodization. Does anyone know what locative media means? 



(No answer) 

Locative media is another word for location based media, this is around 2002 or 2003 when gps was becoming really available to consumers and locative media was kind of this shift in media arts because places like Nokia and Sony were supporting artists using GPS. I started working with technology around that time and everyone was so obsessed with locative media, like we will put GPS on anything and it will be art. As a society we like to distinguish the present and the near future, like was is the new era? The digital era, the Gutenberg era. This usually has a notion of optimism, that new technology will bring new solutions to the problems that we have had for such a long time. But there is a pattern that happens with this discourse, it’s like this very bright california mediaology that the progress in technology will lead to progress in society. The reality is that this is very much a strong marketing strategy, but there is a cycle that happens. I think it this planned obsolescence is an effect of that. 

*...it has eviscerated history, not by banning dissent, but by accelerating the opportunities and channels for critical thought to infinity and therefore making it impossible to think historically in the first place. Thus the central challenge within control society will be not simply to resist the various new nefarious control apparatuses, but to rescue history from its own consummation.* – Alexander R. Galloway, Computers and the Superfold, 2012

Here, Galloway is saying that the history will eat itself if you leave it to be, because we like to think of the future instead of the past. We like to delink ourselves from the past. Practically, let’s think about utopia as the visual culture we are now. Who has been to the Burning Man? Burning Man is this big festival out in California where people come and create this alternative reality for a week, lots of art, lots of drugs...
 
Student 1: You can’t say that, I don’t think it’s fair. It’s just like the City. Yes, there's lots of art, but there's lots of people who don’t take drugs.

Taeyoon: Right.

Student 1: You just got there to experience this different reality, alternative reality, but people always say it’s lots of drugs, but it’s not necessarily lots of drugs.

Taeyoon: So it’s as much drugs as this city?

Student 1: In a group of 60 thousand people there’s going to be drugs and in a million people there’s going to be violence, there’s going to be, you know, bad things that happen and good things that happen.

Taeyoon: But I think the Burning Man crowd takes pride in how unregulated the space was, especially in the early 2000s, an experimental space where anything could happen, including, you know, psychedelic experiences.

Student 1: That’s also just a construct, I mean you should go and see who is doing drugs and who is not doing drugs. I mean, because, you haven’t been. A lot of people just think that you do drugs so you get naked and then you party and fuck everybody, it's not like that though. 

Student 2: That is why some people show up there, though.

Student 1: Sure, but that’s not an easy place to show up, because you have to do a lot of work to get there.

Taeyoon: Yeah, let's not get into the details. Sorry, if I offended you but I was speaking from my experience of hanging with the Burning man enthusiasts in the deserts. I had opportunities to hang with friends who were really into the Burning Man scene in the early 2000s. Many of them neglected the Burning man after some time. I think something happened around 2013 or 2015 with corporate sponsorship and it just got a lot bigger. So there was an offsite we went for a smaller camp. My impression was that it was a sense of freedom to allow different experiments to happen, including drugs.

Student 1: Yeah, Totally.

Taeyoon: And there was a subtext, it wasn’t a drug festival but it was a place where it was socially acceptable to take lots of drugs. Doing drugs at a camp site is nothing like doing drugs at college campuses.  

Student 1: You’ll find monks there, you’ll find religious people there, you’ll find old people, and children there. It a city, it’s like any city. It’s just that you don’t have an authoritarian figure that's going to - if you do get in trouble and you are psychologically neglected or you feel like you need help, there is someplace to go, whereas here you have to go to a hospital and then you get in trouble because you’re doing LSD.

Taeyoon: Fair. I’ve also noticed a lot of like fandom. Where there is this charismatic leader in places like that and there is a following that happens according to how much social capital you have or how big of a ship you have. It is a city in the sense that it has the problems we have, I think the unregulated space that you are talking about was a definite thing. 
But I think most people know this Further Future, right?
The rich people in the Valley decided they wanted to create their own Burning Man with personal assistants, yoga, and organic food.

Student 1: I just want to be clear that I think Burning man is a space for people who don’t necessarily want to do drugs and when it is constantly referred to as a place that is just all about partying and drugs then it really detracts from the type of people who are motivated to go. I think All of you guys would benefit from going, but you don’t have to do drugs just because it’s Burning Man.

Taeyoon: Okay, fair

Let's talk about Etsy Office. This is a new office in Dumbo. I think we talked about open floor plans and how this enforced transparency is very violent. We talked about how open office plan looks great, but it feels bad and how this fridge full of stuff is actually keeping at work for longer amounts of time. I think some of the people who are working on the west coast were saying how it is not actually that enjoyable after a certain amount of time.

Student: 1: Sure, I can share. I actually work at Google about four blocks away and it’s an open floor plan. I think It’s really interesting how you can, how narrative goes both ways, because on the other hand you can look at mid-20th century frank lloyd wright designed buildings and say “Oh, those guys in cubicles, that is like the ultimate form of a control society. But there is still that element of, it is very visible while you are working so you can’t be sitting in your office just looking at unrelated stuff. So there is that element of social pressure in this type of environment.

Student 2: There are a couple of really good mixed medium.com write ups that talk about workaholism encouraged in design studios through the allusion of perks. Like being able to bring your dog to work, beer in the fridge, but it’s all actually just to keep you there as long as possible.

Student 3: And I have to talk about the complicity of designers and architects that actually participate in that because it is a tough thing because there is so much stuff

Student 2: Also, how uncomfortable it is as an outsider to go into some of these places that are telling this communal experience and you utopia, like facebook, everything is community oriented. They all want to be in love and happy in this small community, but there are schools that are underfunded and when you leave as an employee, you’re not sure if you feel guilty for all of the things you are receiving and how can you go through life - or you just ignore it. So it creates this weird cycle, psychotic break between people.


##Privacy

  
Can we define privacy without our words? (I gave about 5 minutes for students to think and write their definition of privacy) 

Student 1: For me I think the most important thing about privacy is that it functions as this kind of this insulation from social norms, that maybe are reactionary and so maybe you have some behaviors, and there’s nothing wrong with them, but people in society would consider them wrong for whatever reason. So privacy kind of allows for this bubble to act out those behaviors and be yourself in that sense and I see that as being important and along these two axes of development so that’s important for your own personal development, in so far as it gives you space to make mistakes without anybody holding you to them. It also affords you the space for to develop ideas and practices that maybe against the social norm but later might become the social norm. So you need this space insulated from judgement or control.

Student 2: I kind of say that exact same thing, but in three words. Those being personhood, boundaries, and seclusion. Essentially you have the ability to be something as a person, be yourself. The boundaries are between you and everything else in reality.

Student 3: I would like to add that there is a sense of control, because you are the rightful owner of whatever it is that you are doing or exploring and you are the only person who can then allow people into that world you’ve created for yourself. So there is a choice, it’s not just that you can have a secret, but that you can choose to keep something.

Francis: Privacy for me is opacity, distance, reserve, attachment, the right not to be defined as a person via social networks being defined by your physical tastes or things you watch, this is privacy as well...  

Student 5: Maybe privacy in the sense of what Francis is talking about, that it is a productive kind of thing. Privacy can be used to dig deep into seclusion but if we are talking about privacy as something that is a creative thing that allows one the space to grow.

Student 3: I think we can also talk about when you invoke privacy, and that would be an intimate or vulnerable situation.

Taeyoon: I think of privacy as a human right, more than anything else.

Francis: Then they call it medicine, like doctors. That patients have the right to privacy. There is professional privacy that has to do with conduct.

Taeyoon: Let’s talk about the privacy of families. Like I am sometimes uncomfortable with parents sharing photos of their children without their consent, so early on, sharing among family members is fine, but social media seems to be very violent.

Let's think about privacy concerning intimacy. This notion of what are we comfortable with sharing. Evgeny Morozov is probably one of the most problematic writers thinking about technology today. He describes Sharing Economy as a digital feudalism, so it’s not only the neo-liberalism or the Hyper-Capitalism, but we’re going back to pre-industrial modes of feudalism. In Feudalism, most people didn’t own anything, the means of production or land. Most people borrowed to produce and then benefit from the merchandise while obeying the structures under the feudal lord. Morzov takes on Citi Bike as an example, we don’t own any of the bikes, we just have access to it. I don’t know how I feel about his statement, however it's interesting the data of Citi Bikes, Uber, and Airbnb are very easy to find online. The current situation reminds me of another Borges story of an empire that was so into cartography that they made maps of the whole city at the size of the city.  The story follows generations later, the new inhabitants that lived in the space were inspired to look at the map. So there were all these ruins of all these 1:1 sized map all over the city that were inhabited by animals and people. 

*... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.* – Jorge Luis Borges, On Exactitude in Science 

Isn’t this story a beautiful reflection of what our data is going to be? We are going to have so much data that no one is going to care about it. 

Let’s focus on individuals and how that is distinguishable from dividual that Deleuze talks about. The dividual means two things, that we are the data or that the corporations think of us as data as opposed to individuals. It also means that we are divided as the oppressor and the oppressed. We are being surveilled and we are surveilling at the same time. This pre-nineteenth century notion of hierarchy doesn’t make sense anymore because we are actively participating. All of this conversation about privacy and surveillance doesn’t mean much without the consideration of the labor. What is the work and what are the modes of production? 

Facebook proposed Reliance-Internet.org to India that they would provide free internet if they use their service, but free as in only to these sites through the interface that they provide. Thrity popular websites free, if they want to access more they have to buy them. This caused a lot of controversy within India and outside, like what does freedom mean in this case if it is only through Facebook’s facilitation. The amount of data they would be collecting and the amount of marketable opportunities are immense. So it actually didn’t happen because of large controversies. However Google is stepping into India and they are providing hardware infrastructure as well as the service because it is one of the largest markets. My friend Surya Mattu used the phrase “data colonialism.” Colonialism, in essence, is a search for human resource and labor. The companies that will provide this collect the potential customers and this is related to all the human labors behind automation and what we think is just AIs. 

This [article](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation) talks about how there are people in South East Asia, that are sitting in offices just checking violent or sex pictures on Facebook and it is manually flagged because there is a limit to how AI will do that. 

The Brave New World is a novel by Aldous Huxley and is often mentioned in relation to George Orwell’s 1984. The Brave New World is a world where there is one giant corporate state and there is no sense of privacy. But what is different from Orwellian vision is that this is a really happy place. There is always music around and a psychedelic substance called Soma that everyone takes to feel happy. 

The Brave New World as we know began in 2001 after the 9/11. 

*Authorization for specified electronic surveillance activities during a limited period to detect and prevent acts of terrorism within the united states.*– President's Surveillance Program Oct. 4, 2001, George W. Bush 
 
This surveillance program that was issued on October 4th says as a temporary measure we will detect and prevent, surveil activities temporarily to protect the United States. If you’re not familiar with the historying of domestic spying that has happened especially from 2001 onward, there's a really detailed [timeline](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline) of what actually happened.  

And we have people like Eric Schmidt saying we should have nothing to hide. 

"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time, and it's important, for example that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities." – [Eric Schmidt on CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6e7wfDHzew) 

It is troubling for two reasons, he says you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place which is a very violent way of approaching the situation and he is also referring to the Patriot Act, which allows the government to require companies to share their data in case of a terrorist threat, but as we know, after the fact it became a new normal. It is a new normalcy for companies to surveil and exchange information with government agencies and other corporations as well. We know from the history of computing that cryptography and surveillance were very central to the development of computers in the first place. I’m tempted to say that this voluntary sharing of information is new, but there are precedents such as the Stasi governments in the East Germany and other places. People volunteered to surveil themselves or each other. 

[Prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)

Espionage and spying is definitely nothing new. As for the protagonists in the espionage, the spy as 007, very elusive, deceive penetrator of the system was always a myth. 007 is questionable for a few reasons because it is very sexist and violent, but it has a stereotype of the engineer who always makes the gadget for 007, Q, and the maternal figure, M. In reality, however, the spy operation was mostly performed by the real life Qs and Ms. Like Alan Turing was designing the cryptography system and Claude Shannon who was trying to code audio messages that could travel over long distances. 

Edward Snowden says 'I dont want to live in a society that does these sort of things'  (Snowden video)

However, in reality of today, Information gathering is done in multiple levels of information transaction, in corporate and govermental institutions, voluntarily and unknowingly. A giant vacuum cleaner that collects all the possible dirts and keeps it in a giant freezer

This notion of the vacuum cleaner as the giant collection of information we share today. There are much more to explore and discuss on the U.S. Government’s surveillance. PRISM and etc. However, I am particularly interested in how this conditions of surveillance affects us, Say Average Joe or Average Taeyoon. Francis, we were just talking about this before class, would you like to share?

Francis: I think a lot of different ways of sort of us, individually, like you mentioned before of how kind of transition of self-governmenting regulation of behaviors, as if we are always being watched. This happened to me personally, I lived in China for a little bit, where there is a lot of government surveillance -- probably more than there is here. I remember every time I wrote an an email or something, in the back of my mind I was thinking “am I saying anything that might get me in trouble.” So even if they weren’t watching me, the effects are still there. The other thing is sort of like what is mentioned here, that it is sort of dissociates behaviors from the time period that they are in. Normally if you are doing something that is considered wrong for that time period, but now it doesn’t matter, even if it’s right during the time period and you actually do that behavior, maybe it’s wrong in the future so they can summon that data and use it against you.

Taeyoon: Can I add something? We also talked about how it’s a privilege to say I have nothing to hide. Instead that privilege is paid by everyone else. I have experienced that I don’t have so much to lose, but other people do and by enforcing the standard you are actually oppressing another person.

Francis: Absolutely, I guess the last point of this kind of surveillance associates you with this pattern recognition like AI and stuff. I think it causes these precursor behaviors to become also under suspect so you’re not actually-- this happens all the time in China, China doesn’t want people politically organizing and protesting, right? So, the behaviors that lead up to that are also suspect. So if you start talking in groups and large groups on chat platforms, then they shut down those groups. Their thing with memes, apparently, is if they get transferred enough times they shut it off too, because this idea can’t propagate too far. So it keeps coming back to the precursor behaviors that lead to the actions that they want to prevent, increasingly also become illegal in a de facto sense of the matter.

Taeyoon: I think this is a good time to think about AI. I don’t have the language to actually understand AI and how it is different from stored program computers and if it is just indexical challenges or if that AI actually shifts the paradigm because human agencies are displaced. What is your thought on that?

Francis: I think of a few things. I guess one of the most interesting things about AI is in relation to conventional surveillance mechanisms. Protecting against illegal search and seizure, meaning that a cop can’t just stop you and look through your stuff. That’s against the Constitution, so people are trying to figure out how this relates to mass surveillance and I think the current precedent is that they can collect as much data as on you as they and it doesn’t count as illegal search and seizure until a human looks at it. So the interesting thing there is that the relationship we increasingly have with AI is this one of anthropomorphization, where we are treating them as humans. So that legally, I wonder, if that would ever cross a threshold where these AI have been doing this pattern recognition becomes sophisticated enough that it is like a human looking at your data and if the Fourth Amendment would kick in there. But even then, it is interesting because if you have a human surveilling you then, theoretically you could negotiate with that person, you could reason with them, you could tell them to go away. You can’t maybe negotiate with an AI.

Taeyoon: And I think on a day to day level, there are discussions about self driving cars and if that would cause an accident it would be a software problem. It would just introduce another level of entanglement that we don’t have the policy for.

Student 1: And with self driving cars, although I can’t wait for them to come, it is tied to the super highways. That we have more and more faster ways to get to a place that we’re only going on that one highway that is controlled. So how we move within our self-driving cars may take us through only places that have shopping malls for us to go to and we won’t get off the beaten path.

Student 2: So when these conversations arise, I always get to a point where I’m like, well what's filtered? We all live our lives in the constant, vast systems of surveillance and control that really dictate what we can do and are monitoring us all the time. But once they are in place it’s really hard to make them go away, right? Like once the infrastructure of prison/prism is held it’s very hard to say, oh take it all down and shut it all down. I don’t know, i feel like it is more of a question of do you feel like it’s possible to go back, or deconstruct these things.

Francis: So actually, this is part of a broader question called the "Reconfiguration Thesis" so this is often a similar thing that is discussed relating to logistics and supply chain management. Walmart and Amazon and all these other companies have these really sophisticated ways of managing who is producing and getting these raw materials. So the reconfiguration thesis in that context asks can we take these technologies that are geared toward this globalized capitalist production and use it towards a socially progressive ends. So I think, yeah, we can ask a similar question of the surveillance infrastructure, can it be used in a different way. One project that I like to connect it to is The Project Cybersyn. Cybersyn was this project that Salvador Allende, who was a democratically elected Socialist president in Chile in the 60s, he had this really grand vision to create a cybernetically planned economy. And this was back when Chile literally had five computers and IBM refused to sell them stuff because they were afraid that Allende would nationalize their company. A product like that which is driven and workers through the cybernetic network manage the economy democratically would actually rely on infrastructure some too, what we see as mass surveillance. And some of that is the same infrastructure that powers Walmart logistics and makes them so efficient at producing things and restocking. That’s one possible positive use for this thing, but it still has its own issues and stuff.

##Drone landscapes 

Moving forward, this notion of surveillance, control, and AI is usually talked about in extreme cases and scenarios, such as governments surveilling your own documents or AI’s making decisions for drone strikes as a preemptive measure. But how do we relate that to the reality that we live in? James Bridle’s Drone Shadows project where he maps out the shadow of the drone as if it were flying over. I like to think about this in the western metropolitan reality. It’s not only western but metropolitian. Even in places like Southeast Asia, where we think of as a place of exploit, there are different layers of reality that happens that the governing class -- even in China there are metropolitian, democratic areas as well as oppressive areas so it is not only a west and east method. Some projects like Drone Stream are very poignant strategy to connect. This project tweets every time a US drone attacks Afghanistan or other places, it tells you where it was and how many people were killed, sometimes there are pictures and sometimes not. This was started as an iPhone app and it was live for a few years until Apple banned it. It is deeply troubling to get these text messages, right? But it is an attempt to connect to the realities that we don’t see.

One of the students of SFPC few years ago made a project that was music from drone data. I was deeply troubled by it, but I didn’t know how to articulate what was troubling about it. I’m still processing that project. I think this API posses amazingly complex ethical issues, like what does it mean to use that? Are contributing to this? This is a problem with the New Media Arts as a means for technocratic control, like the Futurist’s obsession technology that lead to Fascism. What kind of desire are we facilitating? Are we celebrating the technology, are we just aestheticizing it by making audio or are we actually criticizing it from within? 

So this is the question for today: what is the New Weapon? It is a two-fold questions, what is the new weapon govern us and what is the weapon that we have as a device to approach this? Two examples that I think will lead us to more is a counter-surveillance and obfuscation. Obfuscation means that you are intentionally giving so much data that the data becomes meaningless, making the data dirty and corrupt. 

##Counter-surveillance and obfuscation

A little bit about my own project in 2006, Shoot Me If You Can started when the phones first came with cameras. I had this project where a group of players were running around an urban space in Seoul and Tokyo and other places. The goal was to take a picture of other team members and send it to the multimedia message and the human operators are checking all the images that are being shot and if they can recognize it, then they are shot and taken out of the game. So it is like a first person shooting game in real life. We had this absurd situation where adults were becoming children and playing video games in real life. The real question for me though was what do these photos mean? Steve Mann has this diagram that I think is amazing. The opposite of surveillance is Sousveillance, which literally is looking back into the camera, using the same technology to empower ourselves. He created lots of prototypes, kind of like earlier versions of of surveillance devices. He is also heralded as the forebear of wearable technology, but he has a very strong political stance to be against surveillance. I think he is actually not happy about Google Glass and all that stuff that happened afterwards.  Surya Mattu, who I mentioned a few times has created a lot of software, this is one of my favorites NSHEYYY. It sifts the wifi network that is around, and what you can do with that these are the beacon IDs that you bring to a service or website called Wiggle and you put that information into a query and then you can map it. He created this as a cartographical tool to empower as opposed to surveil. His point is that these are possible and it is possible for someone like us to use as opposed to being subject to control we should empower ourselves because he is very wary of empowerment without giving actual power. Technology in this case is a power for us to engage with the abstract systems that govern us.


Francis: With projects like that, that are both critiques and tools at the same time, it seems like they do accomplish showing people what they can do but at the same time they also empower people to potentially do some pretty creepy things. For example, a program that lets you log into someone’s Facebook if they were on public wifi on the same network as you. These things point out flaws in our system, but at the same time they are also sort of ethically complicated because they allow people to do some bad stuff.

Taeyoon: Definitely, I do feel the same way. There’s a notion of propication artists like Surya know this is not a solution but it is pointing to issues that are not talked about, so it is a step forward.

There is mapping, obfuscation, and counter-surveillance. None of these of solutions, but I believe that they do lead us to be better informed about the conditions we live in. Probably my favorite of all is a protest song by Yacht, it’s called Party at NSA. There are very serious artists and exhibitions that are not just provoking so Black Chamber was a recent publication show that looks at all of this. 

We need to think of this outside of the cause and effect and solution, but what is that New World order? Can it be the new world disorder? Can we sabotage the big daddy mainframes? A Cyberfeminist Manifesto.

So back to Deleuze, there is no need to fear or hope, but only look for new weapons. The new weapon is an abstract term and it is our job to figure that out. This relates to the homework or proposition for next week: plan your week without google. I leave this ambiguous intentionally, not using Google could mean not using google service or not using any service that is using Google’s infrastructure. It could also mean finding alternatives to Google. My intention for this is for you to be better informed and know how much we opt into this already.

Francis: I like that you brought up Brave New World, because that is what I had in the back of my mind reading Deleuze’s essay. At the beginning of the novel he sort of talks about how the society is controlled in this way that is very antithetical to the 1984 [top-down authoritarian] vision. He was writing that it was around the time that BF Skinner was doing his operant condition experiments on pigeons. Training pigeons to do certain things so that they get food. He called that experiment behavior shaping. In this brave new world society some people who live in these really luxurious lives but then in another hidden part of the world, in the tropics they have people doing all the hard work. The way he sort of works through that problem in the story is that from birth they’re conditioned to want to do that kind of work and conditioned to want to work in the tropics. I think that is the most important point of this society of control, is that it is not about the person who is your boss telling you want to do because they can make you want to do it. So it all about shaping your desires so that they conform to their own desires as well.
