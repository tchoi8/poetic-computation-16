Intersectional approaches arose from feminist scholarship, which recognized that there were important differences among women and men rather than simply between them. Feminist scholars argued that gender, race and class are interconnected as “intersecting oppressions”.

In the context of violence against women, this elision of difference is problematic, fundamentally
because the violence that many women experience is often shaped by other dimensions of their
identities, such as race and class. Moreover, ignoring differences within groups frequently
contributes to tension among groups, another problem of identity politics that frustrates efforts to
politicize violence against women.

They force us to think about the extent of the evil unleashed specifically by racism. Intrinsic to the perpetration of this evil is the shamelessness of photographing it...grinning spectators... The display of these pictures makes us spectators too. 

Maybe *this* is what most barbarians look like. (They look like everybody else)

The study did not say whether the most egregious examples — the kind of killings at the heart of the nation’s debate on police shootings — are free of racial bias. Instead, it examined a much larger pool of shootings, including nonfatal ones. It focused on what happens when police encounters occur, not how often they happen. (There’s a disproportionate number of tense interactions among blacks and the police when shootings could occur, and thus a disproportionate outcome for blacks.)

  Interviewers at polling stations in malls and other locations around the US and overseas would invite consumers to examine images in return for a modest fee or token gift. Certain predilections became clear: Almost all viewers preferred films with finer grain structures. Caucasians tended to prefer skin that appeared tanner in reproduction than in reality...

frustration and depression breaks me down

descending like they wanted underground

the further our journey the less you care

that's why you laugh at Kanye when he's talking in a chair

but the same conversation but replaced,

is good enough for laughs or a smile on your face,

happy to be singing all our songs to survive,

but when we need help, you don't get off til 5. 

it's powerful to feel so alone in a group

let me break this down for you and tell you how we feel again,
your fear is all you hold on to, so when you see me it's not fair
i have nothing left to give when you don't notice what is wrong,
Charleston left me broken down but it's just another day to you

i ain't got nothing left to give you
and i'm too tired, to even talk about it
while watching the fire,

tasting pain coming from a place of truth

to be another in a messy world
to feel like giving in another turn?
you wouldn't listen if i told you

so how can i become anyone?

  I never touched a watermelon for all kinds of reasons that had been invented by white people, and I knew enough about life by this time to understand that whatever you invent, whatever you project, is you!  So where we are now is that a whole country of people believe I’m a “nigger,” and *I don’t*, and the battle’s on!  Because if I am not what I’ve been told I am, then it means that *you’re* not what *you* thought you were *either*!  And that is the crisis.

Explaining crime and poverty as a result of black behavioral choice, further, disguises ways that crime and poverty are caused by capitalism. Recasting systemic inequality as cultural choice suggests that black people aren’t determined enough – that it’s their own fault they remain in poverty. And out of this economic deprivation comes violence – not because poor people have bad attitudes or cultural deficiencies, but because without a real economic safety net, the machinations required for survival can involve illegal business.

 ##Sympathy — Empathy

"... the differences between the terms *sympathy* and *empathy*. In short: one can be sympathetic to another's pain without feeling the danger of being in the same kind of pain oneself...The main affective component of sympathy is pity. One cannot, however, be empathetic to another's pain without feeling the possiblity that that pain might be inflicted on oneself. To feel empathy, one must identify with the person in pain. The difference between sympathy and empathy might thus be thought of as the difference between identifying *with* and *as*."

 In a once conflicted space of neither here nor there, ada the Alien and her cohort of kindred creatures now flourish in their self-constructed, chimeric universe. The drawings are part of an ongoing, non-linear narrative called aliens, hybrids and ghosts.  Existing somewhere between constructed reality, fantasy, memory and imagination, these creatures and their adventures reflect the layered experiences of people who live in-between worlds and whose fluid identity is not grounded in a singular geography or permanence-based, notion of home.

The speculative narrative follows the expeditions of Dr. Tanimowo, an Afronaut from the future, who travels back in time collecting archeo-biological artifacts in hopes of finding the reasons for the collapse of his culture. The Afronaut constructs his suit of african patterned fabric and other materials available to him in his current time-space. He designs, builds and utilizes 3 artifacts, a communication device, a food device, and a breathing device, that serve as functional apparatus which sustain him during his expeditions.
