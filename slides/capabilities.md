##The Central Human Capabilities

The list itself is open-ended and has undergone modification over time; no doubt it will undergo further modification in the light of criticism. But here is the current version. The Central Human Capabilities 

1. *Life*. Being able to live to the end of a human life of normal length; not dying prematurely, or before one’s life is so reduced as to be not worth living. 

2. *Bodily Health*. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health; to be adequately nourished; to have adequate shelter. 

3. *Bodily Integrity*. Being able to move freely from place to place; to be secure against violent assault, including sexual assault and domestic violence; having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction. 

4. *Senses, Imagination, and Thought*. Being able to use the senses, to imagine, think, and reason—and to do these things in a “truly human” way, a way informed and cultivated by an adequate education, including, but by no means limited to, literacy and basic mathematical and scientific training. Being able to use imagination and thought in connection with experiencing and producing works and events of one’s own choice, religious, literary, musical, and so forth. Being able to use one’s mind in ways protected by guarantees of freedom of expression with respect to both political and artistic speech, and freedom of religious exercise. Being able to have pleasurable experiences and to avoid nonbeneficial pain. 

5. *Emotions*. Being able to have attachments to things and people outside ourselves; to love those who love and care for us, to e grieve at their absence; in general, to love, to grieve, to experience longing, gratitude, and justified anger. Not having one’s emotional development blighted by fear and anxiety. (Supporting this capability means supporting forms of human association that can be shown to be crucial in their development.) 

6. *Practical Reason.* Being able to form a conception of the good and to engage in critical reflection about the planning of one’s life. (This entails protection for the liberty of conscience and religious observance.) 

7. *Affiliation*. 

	A. Being able to live with and toward others, to recognize and show concern for other human beings, to engage in various forms of social interaction; to be able to imagine the situation of another. (Protecting this capability means protecting institutions that constitute and nourish such forms of affiliation, and also protecting the freedom of assembly and political speech.) 

	B. Having the social bases of self-respect and nonhumiliation; being able to be treated as a dignified being whose worth is equal to that of others. This entails provisions of nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, caste, religion, national origin. 

8. *Other Species*. Being able to live with concern for and in relation to animals, plants, and the world of nature. 

9. Play. Being able to laugh, to play, to enjoy recreational activities.

10. *Control* over One’s Environment. 

	A. *Political*. Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one’s life; having the right of political participation, protections of free speech and association. 

	B. *Material*. Being able to hold property (both land and movable goods), and having property rights on an equal basis with others; having the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others; having the freedom from unwarranted search and seizure. In work, being able to work as a human being, exercising practical reason and entering into meaningful relationships of mutual recognition with other workers. 


The basic idea is that with regard to each of these, we can argue, by imagining a life without the capability in question, that such a life is not a life worthy of human dignity.  The argument in each case is based on imagining a form of life; it is intuitive and discursive. Nonetheless, I believe that the process, and the list, can gather broad cross-cultural agreement, similar to the international agreements that have been reached concerning basic human rights. Indeed, the capabilities approach is, in my view, one species of a human rights approach, and human rights have often been linked in a similar way to the idea of human dignity. The capabilities approach is fully universal: the capabilities in question are held to be important for each and every citizen, in each and every nation, and each person is to be treated as an end. The approach is in this way similar to the international human rights approach; indeed I view the capabilities approach as one species of a human rights approach. Arguing in favor of a set of cross-cultural norms and against the positions of cultural relativists has been an important dimension of the approach. But it is also crucial to stress that the approach builds in an important place for the norm of respect for pluralism, and this in six ways. 


 
First, I consider the list as open-ended and subject to ongoing revision and rethinking, in the way that any society’s account of its most fundamental entitlements is always subject to supplementation (or deletion). 

I also insist, second, that the items on the list ought to be specified in a somewhat abstract and general way, precisely in or to leave room for the activities of specifying and deliberating by citizens and their legislatures and courts. Within certain parameters it is perfectly appropriate that different nations should do this somewhat differently, taking their histories and special circumstances into account. Thus, for example, Germany’s interpretation of the free speech right, according to which there can be a good deal of legal regulation of antisemitic speech and political organizing, is rather different from the U.S. interpretation, which protects such speech unless there is an imminent threat of public disorder. Both interpretations seem right, given the different histories of the two nations. 

Third, I consider the list to be a freestanding “partial moral conception,” to use John Rawls’s phrase: that is, it is explicitly introduced for political purposes only, and without any grounding in metaphysical ideas of the sort that divide people along lines of culture and religion. As Rawls says, we can view this list as a “module” (PL 12, 145) that can be endorsed by people who otherwise have very different conceptions of the ultimate meaning and purpose of life; they will connect it to their religious or secular comprehensive doctrines in many ways. 

Fourth, if we insist that the appropriate political goal is capability and not functioning, we protect pluralism here again. Many people who are willing to support a given capability as a fundamental entitlement would feel violated were the associated functioning made basic. Thus, the right to vote can be endorsed by religious citizens who would feel deeply violated by mandatory voting because it goes against their religious conception. (The American Amish are in this category: they believe that it is wrong to participate in political life, but they appear happy that citizens have the right to vote.) The free expression of religion can be endorsed by people who would object to any establishment of religion that would involve dragooning all citizens into some type of religious functioning. Where health is concerned, advocates of a capabilities approach differ about whether the appropriate goal is capability or functioning. My own view is that people should be given ample opportunities to lead a healthy lifestyle, but the choice should be left up to them; they should not be penalized for unhealthy choices. 

Fifth, the major liberties that protect pluralism are central items on the list: the freedom of speech, the freedom of association, the freedom of conscience. By placing them on the list we give them a central and nonnegotiable place. 

Sixth and finally, I insist on a rather strong separation between issues of justification and issues of implementation. I believe that we can justify this list as a good basis for political principles all around the world. But this does not mean that we thereby license intervention with the affairs of a state that does not recognize them. It is a basis for persuasion, but I hold that military and economic sanctions are justified only in certain very grave circumstances, involving traditionally recognized crimes against humanity. So it seems less objectionable to recommend something to everyone, once we point out that it is part of the view that state sovereignty, grounded in the consent of the people, is a very important part of the whole package. 

This is the core of the approach. It has close links with contractarian theories, especially Rawls’s theory, and its critique of Utilitarianism is in key respects the same. In particular, the ideas of human dignity and the inviolability of the person are core intuitive ideas in both theories, and generate the arguments of both against certain types of social aggregation that neglect the separateness of each life. Both approaches are united in opposition to the pursuit of a glorious total or average in ways that subordinate certain groups or individuals; one person’s exceeding well-being is not permitted to compensate for another person’s misery. In both approaches, furthermore, ideas of mutual respect, reciprocity, and the social bases of self-respect play a central role. 

The capabilities approach and Rawlsian contractarianism are allies across a wide space of the terrain of justice, and it seems welcome that theories with somewhat different assumptions and procedures generate closely related results. In *Women and Human Development* I argue that convergence between the best informed-desire approaches and the capabilities approach should give us confidence that we are on the right track. So, too, in this case: if two approaches that share some deep intuitive starting points but differ greatly in procedure and structure should converge across a wide range of recommendations, that convergence should be a source of confidence. Another way of putting the same point is that the capabilities approach can help us extend the Rawlsian approach to three areas that Rawls was unsure his theory could cover. In that spirit, let us now examine more closely some of the differences between the capabilities approach and modern contractarianism.
