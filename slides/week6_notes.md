##Regarding the Pain of Others


Photographs of black victims of [lynching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States) in small towns in the United States between the 1890s and the 1930s... - [Without Sanctuary](http://withoutsanctuary.org/) exhibited in NYC gallery in 2000.

The lynching pictures tell us about human wickedness... Intrinsic to the perpetration of this evil is the shamelessness of photographing it... The display of these pictures makes us spectators, too. 

Nevertheless, it was argued "examine" is substituted for "look at" - the more clinical "examine" is substituted for "look at"- the pictures. 

But, maybe they *were* barbarians. Maybe *this* is what most barbarians look like. (They look like everybody else.)

Intersectional approaches arose from feminist scholarship, which recognized that there were important differences among women and men rather than simply between them. Feminist scholars argued that gender, race and class are interconnected as “intersecting oppressions” (Crenshaw 1989).

#Sympathy and empathy

"... the differences between the terms *sympathy* and *empathy*. In short: one can be sympathetic to another's pain without feeling the danger of being in the same kind of pain oneself...The main affective component of sympathy is pity. One cannot, however, be empathetic to another's pain without feeling the possiblity that that pain might be inflicted on oneself. To feel empathy, one must identify with the person in pain. The difference between sympathy and empathy might thus be thought of as the difference between identifying *with* and *as*."

Eastman Kodak scene-library reference image, circa mid-1980s. To assemble the scene library, which began in 1975, photographers for Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories captured reference images on large format (4x5") film, which were then digitized using a high-resolution microdensitometer. The resulting data were processed for use as standard scenes for the digital simulation of photographic products in development. This image is the property of Eastman Kodak Co. or its successors.

#Do You See My Skin Through the Flames? 

frustration and depression breaks me down
descending like they wanted underground
the further our journey the less you care
that's why you laugh at Kanye when he's talking in a chair
but the same conversation but replaced,
is good enough for laughs or a smile on your face,
happy to be singing all our songs to survive,
but when we need help, you don't get off til 5. 
it's powerful to feel so alone in a group

let me break this down for you and tell you how we feel again,
your fear is all you hold on to, so when you see me it's not fair
i have nothing left to give when you don't notice what is wrong,
Charleston left me broken down but it's just another day to you

i ain't got nothing left to give you
and i'm too tired, to even talk about it
while watching the fire,
