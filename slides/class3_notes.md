In the Borges's short story on a man who remembers everything, the final sentence is a stark revelation of the nature of memory and storage. He has remembers everything and that results in his inability to experience life and make new memory. He's conflating memory and storage, the space a finite space. 

Today we will think about privacy and surveillance, through the lens of 'Control' as the main conceptual mechanism to examine our everyday life on 24/7. 

Let's start by defining Surveillance with our own words.

#Call centers

In this description of the Call centers, Fisher highlights the dual reality of convenience we enjoy.  

As a consumer in late capitalism, you increasingly exist in two, distinct realities: the one in which the services are provided without hitch, and another reality entirely, the crazed Kafkaesque labyrinth of call centers, a world without memory, where cause and effect connect together in mysterious, unfathomable ways, where it is a miracle that anything ever happens, and you lose hope of ever passing back over to the other side, 
where things seem to function smoothly.

*Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism, pg 63*

#Border control 

Postscript on the Society of Control  

- What's the difference between Discipline society? Foucault's critique of Panopticon.
- Disapperance of everyday life - time/space that's traditionally unmonitored by institutions. 
- Continous and unbound regulations  
- Production to financialization, Consumerism to personalization, of individuation of machinic interface, and of mandatory communication.  
- Cybernetics and continous control

what is important is no longer
either a signature or a number, but a code: the code is a password, while on the other hand
disciplinary societies are regulated by watchwords

#Casino

CCTV

Casinos of the past, surveillance was an after thought. Now, security is foregrounded. It's the very first thing architects consider. The building is a camera that monitor circulation of people. Entire building becomes optical apparatus. The mechanism of watching expands to the city, through democratic process, public agreeing to allow surveillance.

#The Dividual 

Key concepts in the society of control

The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks."
 
[Text](https://libcom.org/library/postscript-on-the-societies-of-control-gilles-deleuze)


The distinction between the opressor and the oppressed is no longer valid. We are both at the same time.

Corporate and government surveillance 

Privacy is inherently connected to surveillance. 

#Brave New World 

Story by Aldous Huxley, 1932 

Discouragement of critical thinking, is achieved by abundance of material goods.

Deliminiation of private anything. Instead, public sex and orgy.  

In a Television adaptation of Brace New World by Huxley, there's a scene when the protagonist asks a woman he's in love with, to be together alone privately. The woman, with smile, tells him there's no need for private space. Everyone has everyone, so no one has no one.  

Most importantly, introduction of Soma, a happiness drug. 

The Brave New World as we know began in 2001/9/11.  

But immediately following the date, US President issued the state of emergency, that was meant to be temporary, but became a decade long permanent condition.

#Nothing to hide


Technolot companies played an integral part in construction of this new reality.

"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time, and it's important, for example that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities."

#Prism

Espionage is nothing new, the nature of spying remains the same. and central to computation.

From the cold war period, or even before then, Spys were depictued as decisive, seductive, man of no fear.

However, in reality of today, Spying is done in multiple levels of information transaction, in corporate and govermental institutions. Voluntary and unknowingl. 

It's more like a giant vacuum cleaner that collects all the possible dirts and keeps it in a giant freezer.

Is A.I. just another periodization of the Technology industry? or is A.I. inspiring some radically different questions and concerns? 

What are the technology that's promising empowerment without actually granting power? How to subvert the tools to gain empowerment for all, not only the top 10%.
